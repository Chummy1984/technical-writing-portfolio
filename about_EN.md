#About 

I write to help people understand products and accomplish their goals.

My background includes research, teaching, editing, and translation. I’ve created content for a wide range of audiences, from academic texts to materials designed for users with limited literacy skills.

Today, my focus is on well-structured technical communication, from API references to instructions for everyday devices. My goal is to make language intuitive and self-explanatory.

I work in a structured, analytical, and user-centered way. I use AI pragmatically as a tool. Critical thinking, precision, and attention to detail remain my responsibility.
