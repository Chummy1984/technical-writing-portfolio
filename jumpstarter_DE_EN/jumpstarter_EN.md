## 1. Context

After my car had broken down, I purchased a jump starter to bridge the time before the car battery would get fixed. When applying the device for the first time, I noticed that key elements of the instructions are not only faulty and incomplete, but also dangerous for both user and vehicle. 

In this section, I intend to analyse and revise one essential part of the instructions, considering relevant norms and safety rules.

## 2. Original Instructions (Excerpt)

The following excerpt is taken from the original manual. Steps 1 to 5 illustrate how the jump starter is intended to be used. This excerpt serves as the basis for the subsequent analysis and revision.

## 3. Analysis of Weaknesses

The following analysis highlights the main weaknesses of the original instructions. It considers formal aspects, content-related issues, and critical safety gaps that may affect usability and compliance.

### Formal issues

- **Inconsistent instructions**: The text alternates between commands (“Start the vehicle”) and mere descriptions (“The green light is always on”). This makes it unclear whether the user is expected to take an action or simply observe a status, which can lead to hesitation or mistakes.
- **Terminology problems**: Use of “electrode” instead of the common “terminal”; “smart clip” is not a standardized term.
- **Vague phrasing**: “Exceeds two indicator lights” is unclear; the wording “remains on” is awkward.
- **Formatting**: Important safety aspects (polarity, color coding, sequence) are not highlighted.

### Content issues

- **Incomplete procedure**: No exhaustive guidance on the safe order for removing clamps.
- **Lack of clarity**: Battery charge level is referenced only via “indicator lights,” without any clear threshold (e.g., percentage or voltage).
- **No troubleshooting**: No advice on what to do if the car doesn’t start or if the lights don’t behave as described.
- **Contradictory sequencing**: Step 2 describes both red and green lights flashing, while Step 3 states that the green light “is always on.” This inconsistency might leave users unsure at which point it is safe to continue, increasing the risk of premature or delayed action.

### Safety issues

- **No explicit warnings**: The risk of sparks, reverse polarity, or short circuits is not addressed.
- **Disconnecting sequence missing**: Simply says “remove immediately” without the correct order (negative first, then positive).
- **No environmental context**: No warning against use near fuel vapors, rain, or moving engine parts.
- **Personal safety ignored**: No mention of protective equipment (gloves, goggles).

## 4. Relevant Standards

The following section reviews relevant standards and regulations that apply to technical documentation. It highlights which requirements are not met by the original instructions and explains why these gaps pose a risk to safety and compliance.

| Standard | Requirement | Violation in the Manual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ANSI Z535** (Safety Signs and Labels) | Use of standardized signal words (DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION) and clear formatting of safety messages | No signal words or structured warnings are included |
| **OSHA 29 CFR 1910.145** (General Industry Standards) | Clear indication of hazards for machines and electrical devices | No mention of electric shock, fire, or injury risks |
| **IEC 82079-1** (Preparation of Instructions for Use) | International standard requiring consistent terminology, step-by-step clarity, and inclusion of safety information | Terminology inconsistent, procedures vague, no explicit safety instructions |
| **ISO 3864 / ISO 7010** (Safety Colors and Symbols) | Use of safety colors and pictograms for hazard communication | No pictograms or color coding for safety |
| **UL 2743** (Portable Power Packs) | Safety requirements for jump starters, including polarity, disconnection sequence, and operating environment | No guidance on disconnection order, reverse polarity, or safe operating conditions |

These gaps are not minor editorial flaws but critical safety and compliance issues. The absence of standardized warnings and clear safety instructions increases the likelihood of misuse, accidents, and legal liability.

## 5. Revised Instructions

The original instructions contained unclear terminology, inconsistent style, and several critical safety gaps. The following revised version provides a clear, step-by-step procedure that improves usability, aligns with common safety standards, and minimizes risks for both user and vehicle.

### How to Start Your Car with the Jump Starter

⚠️ **Safety Note**: Do not use the jump starter near flammable vapors, rain, or moving engine parts. Always wear protective gloves and goggles.

1. **Check the device’s charge level.**
    
    Ensure that the jump starter shows at least two indicator lights before use. ⚠️ Do not attempt to start a vehicle if the charge is lower.
    
2. **Connect the clamps to the jump starter.**
    
    Insert the plug of the smart clamp fully into the jump starter until it clicks into place. The indicator lights will begin to flash.
    
3. **Attach the clamps to the car battery.**
    - Connect the red clamp to the positive (+) terminal of the battery.
    - Connect the black clamp either to the negative (–) terminal **or**, if recommended by your vehicle manufacturer, to a solid, unpainted metal part of the engine or chassis (ground).
    
    ✅ The green indicator light must be steady before proceeding.
    
4. **Start the vehicle.**
    
    Turn the ignition key or press the start button. If the vehicle does not start, wait at least 20 seconds before making another attempt.
    
5. **Disconnect the clamps safely.**
    
    Once the engine is running, disconnect the clamps in the following order:
    
    - First remove the black (–) clamp.
    - Then remove the red (+) clamp.
    
    ⚠️ Always keep clamps away from each other and from metal parts of the vehicle.
    

## 6. Conclusion

By revising the original instructions, the jump starter manual now provides a clear, consistent, and safety-focused procedure. The improved version:

- **Enhances safety** by addressing critical risks such as polarity, disconnection order, and environmental hazards.
- **Aligns with international standards** by applying consistent terminology, structured steps, and clear warnings.
- **Improves usability** through precise language, logical sequencing, and intuitive formatting.

Together, these changes significantly reduce the risk of user error and ensure greater protection for both the driver and the vehicle.
