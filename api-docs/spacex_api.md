# Retrieving Launch Data with the SpaceX API

## **tl;dr**
> **Status:** Work in Progress  
> This documentation is currently being developed and will be expanded step by step.
- Explains how to retrieve launch and rocket data from the SpaceX API
- Focus: endpoint structure, filtering, and readable JSON examples
- Demonstrates developer-focused documentation for a real-world API

## 1. Introduction

The SpaceX API provides public information about launches, rockets, and missions.  
It requires no authentication and responds with structured JSON objects.

This documentation demonstrates how to:

- retrieve data from two commonly used endpoints  
- interpret JSON responses  
- link related objects (e.g., launches → rockets)
