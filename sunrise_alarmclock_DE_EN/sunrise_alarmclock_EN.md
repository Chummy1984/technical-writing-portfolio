## 1. Context

I purchased this wake-up light myself and quickly realized that the manual was hard to follow, poorly structured, and inconsistent in tone and terminology. It clearly wasn’t written with non-technical adult users in mind. Key terms were vague, and the flow of use was missing entirely.

As a technical writer, I analyzed some of the weaknesses exemplarily and reworked the content accordingly.

This is the device in question:https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DCG3YP3T?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1

## 2. Objective

My goal was to revise selected parts of the manual to make them more accessible, clearly structured, and intuitive for adult users without a technical background. The focus was on logical organization, consistent terminology, and language that requires no prior knowledge, while remaining precise and accurate.

## 3. Product Overview

### 3.1. Analysis of the Original Control Overview

#### **Strengths**

- Clear illustration with numbered elements
- Complete list of functions
- Order reflects the physical layout of the device

#### **Weaknesses**

- **Inconsistent language:** mix of technical and marketing terms (e.g., “high-quality speaker” vs. “Type-C Input”)
- **Awkward or overly complex phrasing:** e.g., “light brightness control roller”
- **Typos and formatting issues:** e.g., “Sunirse”, not all list items end with a period
- **Product design flaw:** the Alarm 2 button is positioned to the left of the Alarm 1 button, which makes the labeling confusing

### 3.2. Revised Control Overview

While the original overview lists all control elements, it uses inconsistent language and awkward phrasing, which makes it harder to understand. In the revised version, I simplified terminology, clarified multi-function controls, and applied a consistent, neutral, function-focused tone. The order still follows the physical layout of the device.

The product design flaw cannot be corrected here, which means the labeling remains unintuitive for users.

## 4. Table of Contents

### 4.1. Analysis of the Original Table of Contents

#### **Strengths**

- Covers all major device functions
- Includes numbering and page references
- Partial grouping (e.g., snooze functions listed together)

#### **Weaknesses**

- **Redundant and fragmented**: e.g., *Alarm Switch* vs. *Alarm Setting*, snooze features split across multiple entries
- **Inconsistent terminology**: *Lights – Sunrise*, *Lights – Solid LED Lights*, and *RGB Lighting Mode* are not clearly distinguished
- **Unclear or awkward phrasing**: e.g., *Pre-bright snooze*, *Contact US* (stylistically and typographically incorrect)
- **No logical grouping**: lacks higher-level categories like “Audio,” “Lighting,” or “Connectivity”
- **Device-centered rather than user-centered**: reflects control layout more than user intent
- **Poor sequence**: e.g., Bluetooth Mode appears late, although it’s a core feature

### 4.2. Revised Table of Contents

#### **Table of Contents**

1. Product Setup and Maintenance
2. Time and Display Settings
3. Alarm Functions and Snooze Mode
4. Bluetooth Mode
5. Sleep Functions
6. Light Functions

## 5. Product Setting and Maintenance

![Product Setting.jpg](attachment:8383a59e-7952-4c3c-822d-470a15cb3722:Product_Setting.jpg)

## 5.1. Analysis of the “Product Setup and Maintenance” Section

#### Strengths

- Covers all essential topics: power supply, battery, storage, and cleaning
- Clear numbering of subsections
- Partial functional separation into meaningful individual steps

#### Weaknesses

- **Content-related**
    - Technically inaccurate / outdated: “CR2032 battery” is incorrect, as the device actually uses a built-in, non-removable battery
    - Battery function unclear: no explanation that the battery only stores settings in case of power loss
    - Power supply wording is confusing: “Power jack” vs. “USB cable” - not clearly distinguished
    - “DC adapter” not specified
    - No clear statement that the device does not function without a continuous power connection
- **Language**
    - Grammar issues and style breaks:“use.the battery preserve” - sentence structure error
    - “Please DO NOT …” in all caps appears loud and overly harsh
    - Cumbersome phrasing:“plug the power jack connector into the port on the back side of the product” - clunky, hard to read
    - “extreme humidity” - overly dramatic, lacks precision
- **Style / Formatting**
    - Unprofessional typography: inconsistent spacing, no clear visual hierarchy
    - No distinction between essential and optional functions
    - Overly nested opening sentence instead of a clear step-by-step instruction

### 5.2. Revised “Product Setup and Maintenance” Section

#### Product Setup and Maintenance

Before using the alarm clock for the first time, plug the supplied USB cable into the USB-C port of the clock and connect it to a power adapter.

The clock requires a constant power connection.

1. Battery Setup

The clock has a built-in battery. Remove the insulating strip before first use. The battery stores your settings in case of a power interruption.

1. Product Storage

Store the clock in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight and exposure to moisture.

1. Product Cleaning

Remove dust with a soft, slightly damp cloth. Do not use liquid or abrasive cleaning agents.

## 6. Conclusion

This sample revision demonstrates how technical content can be improved through clear language, logical structure, and user-centered thinking. Even without a complete rewrite of the manual, the experience becomes significantly more accessible for users with limited technical background. Of course, a full adaptation of the entire manual would be necessary to ensure consistency. 

The combination of analysis, structural clarity, and linguistic simplification reflects the core of my approach as a technical writer.
